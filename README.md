# Project Summary

The goal of SeedSigner is to lower the cost and complexity of Bitcoin multi-signature wallet use. To accomplish this goal, SeedSigner offers anyone the opportunity to build a verifiably air-gapped, stateless Bitcoin signing device using inexpensive, publicly available hardware components (usually < $50). SeedSigner helps users save with Bitcoin by assisting with trustless private key generation and multi-signature wallet setup, and helps users transact with Bitcoin via a secure, air-gapped QR-exchange signing model.

Additional information about the project can be found at [seedsigner.com](https://seedsigner.com).

You can follow [@SeedSigner](https://twitter.com/SeedSigner) on Twitter for the latest project news and developments.

# Shopping List

To build a SeedSigner, you will need:

* Raspberry Pi Zero (preferably version 1.3 with no WiFi/Bluetooth capability, but any Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 or Zero model will work)
* Waveshare 1.3" 240x240 pxl LCD (correct pixel count is important, more info at https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.3inch_LCD_HAT)
* Pi Zero-compatible camera (tested to work with the Aokin / AuviPal 5MP 1080p with OV5647 Sensor)

Notes:
* You will need to solder the 40 GPIO pins (20 pins per row) to the Raspberry Pi Zero board. If you don't want to solder, purchas "GPIO Hammer Headers" for a solderless experience.
* Other cameras with the above sensor module should work, but may not fit in the Orange Pill enclosure
* Choose the Waveshare screen carefully; make sure to purchase the model that has a resolution of 240x240 pixels

# Software Installation
The quickest and easiest way to install the software is to download the most recent "seedsigner_X_X_X.zip" file from the [software releases](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/releases) section of this repository.

After downloading the .zip file, we recommend that you verify its integrity using the steps below.   
Next, unzip or extract the seedsigner.img file, and write it out to a MicroSD card (minimum 4GB size).  Now insert the MicroSD into the assembled hardware and turn on the power!  

If you require is a more trustless installation, you can follow the [manual installation instructions](docs/manual_installation.md).

## Verifying your download files (optional, but recommended!)
You can verify the authenticity and data integrity of the software with as little as 3 commands. This process assumes that you know [how to navigate on a terminal](https://terminalcheatsheet.com/guides/navigate-terminal) and have navigated to the folder where you have these  files present: (This will most likely be your Downloads folder.)


* seedsigner_0_5_x.img.zip (from the [software releases](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/releases) section)
* seedsigner_0_5_x.img.zip.sha256 (also from the [software releases](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/releases) section)
* seedsigner_0_5_x.img.zip.sha256.sig (also from the [software releases](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/releases) section)

**Note:** The version numbers of the files might not match the above examples, but the naming format will be the same.

This process also assumes you are running the commands from a computer where both [GPG](https://gnupg.org/download/index.html) and [shasum](https://command-not-found.com/shasum) are already installed.

### Importing the public key of the Seedsigner Project  
The first command you will run is to add (or update) the *public key* of the SeedSigner project into your computers *keychain*. The *fetch-keys*  command shown below will fetch the projects public key from a popular online keyserver called *Keybase.io*. After the key is imported successfully, we will visually compare its properties to various websites to confirm it is genuine.
```
gpg --fetch-keys https://keybase.io/SeedSigner/pgp_keys.asc
```
When  the command completes successfully, it will display a numeric ID, as circled red in the example below. We will use that numeric ID in the next step.

![SS - Keybase PubKey import with Fingerprint shown (New import or update of the key)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91296549/174248861-7961c038-1fbf-47a1-a110-146cb218b1c8.jpg)  
   
Now open the website [Keybase.io/seedsigner](https://www.keybase.io/SeedSigner) 

![SS - Keybase PubKey Verification via visual fingerprint matching3-50pct](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91296549/174390488-28f3e5af-dfe7-47d7-b69c-54971a00db17.jpg)

These numeric IDs are known as the keys *fingerprint*, and now you will now compare them.Carefully check that the *imported* fingerprint and the *website* fingerprint match exactly. You should ignore the white spaces, which are just there to help readability. 

If the 2 fingerprints are an exact match, then this means that the public key that you have just imported, does genuinely belong to the SeedSinger project. So you now know *who* the public key belongs to.  
In the next step you will make certain that this *same* key signed your downloaded files.  

<details><summary> Expand this section if you are curious about what the 2 matching fingerprints prove and what they do.</summary>     

Well, the Keybase.io website has a unique ability to *cryptographically* confirm that the public key specified is *actually from the same people* who manage all of Seedsigner's online presence! 

Keybase.io does this by requesting some "social proofs" of the Seedsigner project's [human] leaders. By completing these specific tasks online, the humans prove *they are who they say they are*, online. 
(Much like how  Satoshi could prove that they are __real__ Satoshi, by moving a single bitcoin from the known Satoshi wallet.) 
Keybase's magic is achieved by asking the Seedsigner Project's leaders to announce their ownership of their public key in all of their online channels, and then prove cryptographically that it was really done. This proof is done across (2 or more) of their known online or social media channels,  eg the project website (seedsigner.com), their Twitter account (@seedsigner) and their GitHub account (github.com/seedsigner). Keybase will then confirm, -cryptographically-, that they did in fact manage to do the tasks exactly as instructed, and hence it confirms that *they are who they say they are.* 
Keybase then continues to periodically check the public proof that this key is still from them.

### Verifying that your download is genuine  
The next steps will show you how to confirm that your downloaded .zip file is the genuine and unaltered SeedSigner software.  
You will achieve this by electronically comparing the *hash* value of *your* zip file to the *original* zip fileâ€™s hash value, and also use  the public/private key pair cryptographic signatures. 

The two steps are:  
1.	Determine *who* signed the sha256.sig file which you downloaded earlier.  
To establish this, the GPG *verify* command will utilized.  
A *verify* command will loop through all the public keys on your computer and identify *which* key pair signed your sha256.sig file, by [cryptographically] comparing it to the un-signed, plaintext version of the same file (.sha256).   
When the command finds a resulting fingerprint, you will visually check  that this fingerprint also matches the same fingerprint you found on Keybase.io/Seedsigner.  
2.	Lastly, you will use the *shasum* command to generate (and compare) the hash value of your *downloaded* Zip file to the hash value of the *original* Zip file (as noted inside of the .SHA256 plaintext file).  
If the 2 hashes match, then your downloaded zip file is **safe for use**, because it is genuinely from the Seedsigner project team and is also confirmed as unaltered!  



**Step one:**      Run the *verify* command :  
```
gpg --verify seedsigner_0_*_*.img.zip.sha256.sig
```
**Note:** The `*`s in the command will auto-match to the version number in your current folder. It should be copied and pasted as is.


The reponse **must** include the phrase **"Good signature"**, like this: 
```
Good signature from "seedsigner <btc.hardware.solutions@gmail.com>" [unknown]  
``` 
If it displays "BAD signature", then you must stop here immediately and contact us for assistance.  

This warning message however, is normal and is expected.
```
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!  
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
```
The last line will display a key fingerprint. you must now confirm that this fingerprint matches the fingerprint you found on Keybase.io/Seedsigner.   

**Step Two:**  Run the *shasum* command :   
**On Linux or OSX**
```
shasum -a 256 -c seedsigner_0_*_*.img.zip.sha256
```

**Windows**
```
CertUtil -hashfile  seedsigner_0_*_*.img.zip SHA256 | findstr /v "hash"
```

The reponse must include the text **seedsigner_[VersionNumber].img.zip OK**, like this:   
```
seedsigner_0_5_x.img.zip: OK
```

The **OK** result means that 2 hashes are an exact match, and thus your zip file is **safe for use**.  It is has been succcesfully verified as both genuinely produced by the SeedSigner project team themselves and not also not altered in any way.   
If it does ***not*** show "OK", then immediately stop here and ask for assistance!   

**Well done - your zip file is now confirmed as authentic**!   
You can now extract the zip file contents, and copy the .img file onto your MicroSD card. We recommend using the Balena Etcher or Pi Imager applications to perform that step.  
When thats complete, simply insert the MicroSD card into your SeedSigner and apply power.  

Note: Please recognize that the software verification process can only validate the software to the extent that the entity that published the software is an honest actor, and their private key is not somehow compromised.

# Enclosure Designs

### Open Pill

The Open Pill enclosure design is all about quick, simple and inexpensive depoloyment of a SeedSigner device. The design does not require any additional hardware and can be printed using a standard FDM 3D printer in about 2 hours, no supports necessary. A video demonstrating the assembly process can be found [here](https://youtu.be/gXPFJygZobEa). To access the design file and printable model, click [here](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner/tree/main/enclosures/open_pill).

### Orange Pill

The Orange Pill enclosure design offers a more finished look that includes button covers and a joystick topper. You'll also need the following additional hardware to assemble it:

* 4 x F-F M2.5 spacers, 10mm length
* 4 x M2.5 pan head screws, 6mm length
* 4 x M2.5 pan head screws, 12mm length

The upper and lower portions of the enclosure can be printed using a standard FDM 3D printer, no supports necessary. The buttons and joystick nub should ideally be produced with a SLA/resin printer. An overview of the entire assembly process can be found [here](https://youtu.be/aIIc2DiZYcI).
